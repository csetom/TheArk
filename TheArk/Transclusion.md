Transclusion allows you to insert the contents of one [[Tiddler|tiddler]] into another. It's a convenient way to reference the same information in multiple places without duplicating text. This helps ensure consistency as changes to the transcluded tiddler are reflected throughout your tiddlywiki. To transclude a tiddler, enclose it in double curly brackets: `{{Transcluded Tiddler}}`.

[[Transclusion Example]] demonstrates how transclusion works.
