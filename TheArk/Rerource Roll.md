This is an alternate system for the management of
resources and the acquisition of gear that avoids the
specific tracking and accounting of money in favor of a
fast and fun dice-based approach. It is an optional system
to use as you see fit. During the course of a campaign,
resources often grow and can be broken down into three
broad categories: scant, moderate, or great.
In this system (and in the Gear section), each item has
a Value Rating and an Availability Rating, both listed
as a modifier. GMs should feel free to alter both ratings
per the situation; some places may have a surplus of a
particular type of item, while others may have very little
chance of having something like that on hand.
And, naturally, the laws of supply and demand will rule:
If something has a high Availability penalty (meaning it’s
in short supply), it will likely be much more expensive,
thus having a harsher Value Modifier.

{{Resource Rolls Table}}

`*` - When a character suffers a loss to his Resource Die,
it will regenerate back to this level at a rate of one die
type per month.

At any point in the story where the Heroes come across
access to treasure or resources of significance, the GM
should raise their Resource die type by one or two levels,
the latter if they come across a real hoard. Heroes can also
simply give one or more die levels of Resources to other
characters, literally one for one. As a general rule, Heroes
should get a Resource die increase once per Rank, at least,
up to a maximum of d10 (d12 if the Hero has either Noble
or Filthy Rich).

When a Hero wishes to buy an item, the GM generates
modifiers by the means described above. The Hero then
rolls his Resource roll; this is a Trait roll, so it has a Wild
Die and can Ace. If he succeeds, the item is acquired. If the
item is attained, a second Resource roll is required. This
cost roll is made against a standard success level of 4 with
the item’s Value Ratings applied. On a failure, the Hero’s
Resource die drops two levels. On a success, the Resource
roll drops one level. On a raise, the die level remains
unchanged.

A group of Heroes may make cooperative Resource rolls
to aid the primary purchaser. Each success and raise gives
the primary purchaser a +1 on their Resource roll. The
second roll to determine cost is made as usual, but thanks
to the support of the group, he only loses a die level in his
Resources on a failure, and nothing otherwise. Any Hero
using his Resource Trait to help another loses the ability to
make any purchases during that same period of time.
The time to seek out the item and make the acquisition
is usually about 1 hour per level of the Availability
Rating of the item; one hour for a Surplus item, up to
five hours for a Rare one. The attempt can normally be
retried if there’s a failure, unless the GM decides that the
item is simply not available in the area

### Resource Rolls in Action

One: Gorim wants to buy a new axe, and his Resource
die is a d8. The GM uses the standard modifiers: +0 for the
Value, and +2 for the Availability.
Gorim rolls his d8 and a Wild Die and gets a 5 and a
1. Adding the +2 total modifier, he’s got a 7 and a 3. He’s
bought the axe.
He then rolls again, getting a 5 and a 2, so his Resource
die goes down a level to a d6.

Two: Lan’toff seeks a suit of Shay’von Leather Armor at
a town fairly far away from any elven settlements. The GM
decides to use the full Value and Availability modifiers.
This means the eldakar mage is facing a total penalty of
-12 to the roll!

His own Resource die is a d8. Others in the party are
around and decide to try and help him. Alaria rolls a 7,
giving him a +1. Arianna rolls a 9, giving him a +2. Lan’toff
decides to employ Persuasion and rolls a 6; with his +2 on
Charisma, this becomes an 8, giving him a raise. This adds
another +2, for a total of +5 to his Resource roll. Lan’toff
rolls an 8 (the Resource die aces) and a 5; he re-rolls the 8
and comes up with a 4, making the roll a 12. With his +5,
he gets a 17. Even with the -12, he’s generated a success
result and he has acquired the Shay’von Leather armor.
He then rolls his Resource die check again, this time
getting a 3 and a 2 (the +5 from before doesn’t apply). At
a -6 Value penalty, his final total is a -3. Because members
of his group helped him, it’s not as disastrous as it could
be; instead of losing two die levels, as he would have on his
own, his Resource die merely drops to a d6.

Three: Erasmus Flint is in Lanthor, and needs to get his
hands on an elvish long sword for one of his upcoming
schemes. This has a -12 penalty. Erasmus has access to
a great deal of resources, giving him a d10, and his local
connections give him a +2 to his roll. He’s able to get a
couple of raises on a Persuasion roll, giving him +3 more.
He rolls and gets an 8. Even adding his +5, he can only
generate a 13 — not enough with a -12 modifier, and the
GM determines he’s not going to find an elvish long sword
anytime soon.

He doesn’t have to roll the second Resource roll, since he
didn’t really spend anything.
Liner Notes: Load Limits
I don’t pay a whole lot of attention to them. Instead,
I pretty much “eyeball” it, mostly relying on the players
to be reasonable.

If I catch someone with a d4 or d6 Strength trying
to wear heavy armor and carry a maul, I will call
them on it, whereas someone with a d10 Strength and
Brawny will generally be able to carry most anything
they want.

The biggest thing to consider on a fantasy-genre
character is their armor. I give d4 Strength characters
either no armor, or leather. Characters with d6
Strength get leather, studded, or maybe scale, while
d8 Strength characters get scale or chain. Those who
start with d10 Strength or better may start with plateand-
chain, if the story and their background warrant
it, or they have a decent starting Resource die.

### Gear Lists and Descriptions

Assuming the characters start in any kind of nondeprived
situation, they begin with gear, armor, and
weapons that make sense for their backstory, skill set,
and attributes. A GM may wish to use the Resource Rolls
system right from the start for character creation or just
assign Gear. Even if you don’t wish to use it for the whole
process, you should certainly feel comfortable using it in
cases where a player wants his Hero to start with something
extraordinary.

In the accompanying Liner Note on “Load Limits,”
there’s a good thumbnail guide for assigning armor. Bear
in mind that it takes someone with good resources to start
with plate-and-chain, and only under an extraordinary set
of resources and circumstances should a character begin
with plate armor, such as a strong knight with a Noble
background. Again, using the Resource Rolls system can
help simplify this.

It is important to note that Shaintar has a slightly
different set of listings for armor. In addition, many other
items have been adjusted to fit more naturally with the
technology, craftsmanship, development, and economics
of Shaintar.

In the typical Shaintar campaign, the heroes are not only
assigned their armor and weapons, but also get any basic
incidental equipment that makes sense. You should feel
free to keep it very simple: “You have basic survival gear
and a week’s worth of rations, in addition to your clothes,
armor, and weapons.” Just give them the various kits and
packs listed below that apply and move on.
However, if you have players who want more details or
are much more into what they are carrying and what they
might have for contingencies, have them present you with
a list of specifics.

If you prefer the more traditional approach, that’s fine
too. All costs listed are in copper pieces, the basic unit
of currency in Shaintar that fulfills the role of a dollar in
modern currency; a silver piece is worth ten coppers, while
a gold piece is worth a hundred. The average Shaintar
character will begin with 500 coppers, while a rich one will
start with 1500 and a Filthy Rich one will have 2500.
Something with a “n/a” cost, however, must be found
on a quest or granted as a gift. These are items that are
rarely traded and are not available under any normal
circumstances.
