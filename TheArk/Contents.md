This [[Tiddler|tiddler]] summarizes the three content-specific sidebars and the related top-level [[TheArk/Tag|tags]] for each category.

## [[TheArk/Campaign]]: tag: [[TheArk/Campaign]]
This top-level category/sidebar contains information on the people/places/things/events of the game world.

<div class="tc-table-of-contents">
    <<toc-selective-expandable "campaign">>
</div>

## [[TheArk/Mechanics]] tag: [[TheArk/Mechanics]]
Game rule information and game system notes.

<div class="tc-table-of-contents">
    <<toc-selective-expandable "mechanics">>
</div>

## [[TheArk/Wiki]] tag: [[TheArk/Wiki]]
Wiki-related details, templates and similar information.

<div class="tc-table-of-contents">
    <<toc-selective-expandable "wiki">>
</div>

These tiddlers are not transcluded, because they all transclude the [[TheArk/Contents]] tiddler too, which would create redundancies. **Do not tag these tiddlers with their own tag**. Doing so causes recursive loops in sidebars.
