A tiddler is the fundamental unit of information in TiddlyWiki. You can decide for yourself what to include in each tiddler, but it's a good idea to limit each tiddler to a single feature, idea or game element. You can then collate multiple tiddlers into larger collections of information using [[Transclusion|transclusion]].
