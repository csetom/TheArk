Creating a link from one [[Tiddler|tiddler]] to another is simple: just enclose it in double square brackets. For example this link: [[TheArk/Tag]] is written `[[Tag]]`.

### Linking Philosophy

- If a tiddler mentions another, create a link.
- Only link the first mention of a tiddler.
- Don't link a tiddler to itself except with the header template (see, for example [[H1]]).
