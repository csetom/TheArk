This is a [[http___tiddlywiki.com|TiddlyWiki]] I've set up to store and organize information for role-playing game campaigns. I've also tried to demonstrate some of the features that make TiddlyWiki such a powerful tool. You're free to use this as you like, but you may want to review the TiddlyWiki [[License|license]].

### Who Am I?
My name is Mark, and I've been playing and running RPGs for a long time. I think TiddlyWiki is an awesome tool for GMs. This is copy of my starting TiddlyWIki. I've used some version of this file to run a half-dozen campaigns. I hope you find it useful.
