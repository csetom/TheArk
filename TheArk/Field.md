TiddlyWiki [[Tiddler|tiddlers]] can have fields associated wtih them. Fields are structured data you can access using markup (see [[DLIST]], for example). 

This TiddlyWiki regularly uses two fields:

- sdesc - a user-defined field that contains a short summary of the tiddler's content.
- list - a system field that affects the sort order of tiddlers in lists (see [[TheArk/Tag]], for example).

[[https___tiddlywiki.com_#Order%20of%20Tagged%20Tiddlers_%5B%5BOrder%20of%20Tagged%20Tiddlers%5D%5D|This page on tiddlywiki.com]] provides a detailed explanation of tiddler sorting.
