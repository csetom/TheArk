- PP: 10 (+4)
- Powers: 2 (+2) 
- SIGATURE POWER (0.5)
-- Detect magic vagymi
- Channeling tool (-0.5)
-- Mages from this Arcane Background have an easier time activating powers when they use some specific tool. Examples: a sorcerer’s staff, the symbol of a priest’s deity.
- TEMPERING TOOL (-0.5)
-- A simple failure during any power activation without using a Tempering Tool results in Backlash. Also, Shorting is unavailable to mages without their Tempering Tool.
- DISCONNECTION BACKLASH  (0)
**On a Critical Failure, the caster loses connection to her magic source (but active powers remains active). She suffers a –2 penalty to every arcane skill she rolls until she can perform some act of “reconnection”. This usually takes one hour of full rest, meditation, or prayer. Another Backlash while disconnected totally prevents the use of powers until “reconnection”.
- CHANNELING SITUATION (+1/2)
-- Under certain conditions (in specific terrain, specific time of the day) mages with this Arcane Background can better channel their magic energies. 
**Under said situation, the mage gains a +1 to his arcane skill rolls.
-- The situation should not happen more than half of the time in a typical adventure. If the situation is rare (below one fourth of the time), the mage gains a +2 instead.
