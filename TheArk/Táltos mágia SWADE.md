*Toolos táltos: 
-- Powers: 3 (+3)
-- Enabling tools (-1) 
***Mages from this Arcane Background can’t use their arcane skill to activate powers, Test, or support without using a specific tool (or substance, or similar condition)
*Táncos Táltos:
-- Powers: 2 (+2)
-- Shader arcane skill (+1/2)
--- Performance, de meglehet egyezni velem.
-- Loud and clear (-1/2)
--- The Arcane Background requires loud chants and precise movements from both hands (and sometimes even their body, like dancing) to activate powers. He can’t do so if Bound, nor when wielding weapons or carrying a shield (he is considered Unarmed Defender, unless he has Natural Weapons). 
--- The silence power does not prevent them  from casting. Talking loud is to make sure you use the right word with the right pronunciation and to channel the right amount of energy in the process. It doesn’t matter if noone can hear you.

- PP: 5 (+2)
- Extra Effort (+3)
- (Ceremonies only. Utana kell olvasnom megint) (0)
- DYNAMIC BACKLASH (-1/2)
-- Savage Worlds’ Dynamic Backlash Setting Rule can be used for individual Arcane Backgrounds. It carries the feelings of high risk high reward, as well as magic is hard to control.
- CHANNELING SITUATION (+1/2)
-- Under certain conditions (in specific terrain, specific time of the day) mages with this Arcane Background can better channel their magic energies. 
**Under said situation, the mage gains a +1 to his arcane skill rolls.
-- The situation should not happen more than half of the time in a typical adventure. If the situation is rare (below one fourth of the time), the mage gains a +2 instead.
