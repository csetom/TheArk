I am not a fan of [[CamelCase]] linking, so it's turned off in this TiddlyWiki. If you want to use it, you can turn it on in the [[$__ControlPanel|Control Panel]] Settings tab (**Enable automatic CamelCase linking**).

If you turn on automatic CamelCase, you can prevent automatic linking for specific words by prepending a tilde character: **~TiddlyWiki**
