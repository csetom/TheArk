A tag is a mechanism for organizing [[Tiddler|tiddlers]]. In this TiddlyWiki, tags are used to create structure, provide fast access to related tiddlers, and build the [[TheArk/Campaign]], [[TheArk/Mechanics]], and [[TheArk/Wiki]] sidebars.

A tag can also be a tiddler. Each tag tiddler in this tiddlywiki uses a [[TheArk/Template|template]] that shows the contents of its `sdesc` [[Field|field]] and a list of tiddlers it tags. Each tag tiddler is also tagged with [[TheArk/Tag]]. Yes, it's tags all the way down.

### Tagging Philosophy

- Everything should have at least one tag (except for select high-level tiddlers).
- Tags are hierarchical and should add structure.
- Every tag should have an associated tiddler that summarizes its meaning.
- Use tags in fields with care. Some fields show up in indexes that list field contents.
- Tag tiddlers should use the [[TAGDESC]] template to provide a consistent look/feel.
-- Changes to the template will ripple through all tag tiddlers.

Consider new tag names carefully. They should reflect what the content they tag is and not be easily confused with other subject matter. Compare, for example, [[military]] versus [[soldier]] or [[politician]] versus [[government]].
